# Rainmeter To Do List Skin

> Made just for fun!  
> I wanted a simple to-do list always visible on my workspace, just like on Linux.  
> After discovering Rainmeter, I decided to create my own to-do list skin, even though I knew nothing about Lua.  
> With the help of AI, it became a one-day challenge and a great learning experience.  
> Now I know the basics of Lua and almost nothing of how Rainmeter scripting works!
